Script that installs archlinux based on a json configuration file!

Major customization options will be included soon.

# Tasks
- [ ] Add support for disk partition & formatting.
- So far disk partition and formatting is not included in this script so you will have to partition manually before you run the script.

- So far this script does not include any configuration presets for desktop enviorments.
